OpenID Connect is a Piwigo plugin which allows single sign-on logins using the OpenID Connect protocol. The protocol utilizes both the OpenID Connect Core and the OpenID Connect Discovery specifications. The plugin supports both the authorization code flow, as well as the (legacy) resource owner credentials flow, otherwise known as the password flow. Although legacy and recommended against, by enabling this flow, login through the Piwigo webservice API is enabled.
